# Relational Datasets

Hereâ€™s a list of links to datasets for relational learning and inductive logic programming. 
While it's not exhaustive, I hope you find it helpful!

## Classic ILP datasets

A collection of benchmark datasets that have been widely used in the field of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) for developing, testing, and comparing ILP algorithms. 

These datasets are well-known within the ILP community and often include complex, structured data that suits tasks requiring relational learning or reasoning. 
They serve as standardized test cases for research, enabling consistent evaluation and comparison of different ILP approaches.

* [klog](http://klog.dinfo.unifi.it/datasets.html) Datasets as Prolog files:
  -  **WebKB**: Originally developed by M. Craven et al. (1998). The version available here is a direct conversion to Prolog of the data available at the Alchemy website. 
  - **Internet Movie Database**: Data extracted from this database has been used in a number of relational learning papers. The version available here was downloaded from the IMDb website, converted into SQL using the prodecure described in http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/docs/README.sqldb.txt and finally a subset of the tuples was converted into a Prolog file. 
  - **UW-CSE** The data set originally developed at University of Washington for demonstrating the capabilities of Markov logic networks. The version available here is a direct conversion to Prolog of the data available at theAlchemy website. 
  - **Bursi** This data set contains 4,337 molecules labeled according to mutagenicity (2,401 mutagens and 1,936 nonmutagens). Originally developed by Kazius et al (2005) it has been used in a number of machine learning papers, especially those studying graph kernels. 
  - **Biodegradability** This is an older data set of chemical structures containing 328 compounds labeled by their half-life for aerobic aqueous biodegradation (a regression task).
